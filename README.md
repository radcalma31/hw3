# PROJECT OVERVIEW
# The Docker-based Real-time Weather Dashboard project aims to provide a user-friendly web application for accessing real-time weather information for any location specified by the user. The application utilizes a public weather API, Docker for containerization, and a combination of frontend and backend technologies to achieve its objectives.

# SETUP AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
# Step 1: Setup the Project Structure
# Create a new directory for your project. Inside this directory, create separate folders for the frontend and backend parts of your application.
# Step 2: Set up the Backend
# 2.1 Install Node.js and Express
# 2.2 Create Backend Files
# Step 3: Set up the Frontend
# 3.1 Choose a Frontend Framework
# 3.2 Create Frontend Files
# Step 4: Dockerize the Application
# 4.1 Create Dockerfile
# 4.2 Build (docker build -t weatherdashboard) and Run (docker run -p 3000:3000 weatherdashboard) Docker Image

# USAGE GUIDE
# Step 1: Access localhost:3000
# Step 2: Enter any city name
# Step 3: Click Submit
# Result: Temperature, weather, wind speed, humidity, sunrise time, and sunset time will be displayed.

# Challenges:
 
# Folder structure: Difficulty in managing where files should be put or commands should be executed from. Overcame by using clear naming convention, separating concerns into logical components, following best practices, documenting the structure, and using relative paths for referencing files.
# Programming capability: As average as the homework may it seem, not being a programmer by nature made it a little bit more challenging. Overcame by researching for answers.
# Time constraint: Due to the limited time, we had to quickly come up with a solution on how to finish the assignment. Overcame by working together on a set time to be more efficient.

# Key Learnings:
 
# API Integration: Learn how to integrate third-party APIs into your application and handle responses effectively. 
# Backend Development: Gain experience in backend development using Node.js and Express. 
# Frontend Development: Learn frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
